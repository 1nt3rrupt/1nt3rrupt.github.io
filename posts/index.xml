            <description>Hardware I am using a Lenovo laptop (Ideapad 110-15AST). It comes with AMD A9 9400, 8 GB of RAM, a 1 TB hard disk. Its an old laptop but it gets the work done.
I have an Asus M1 Pro which I just bought mainly for its 5000 mAh Li-Po battery.
Software I use both linux and Windows OS. I use Manjaro Linux (bspwm). I have tried many distros but I like Manjaro Linux the most.</description>

<p>I am using a Lenovo laptop (Ideapad 110-15AST). It comes with AMD A9 9400, 8 GB of RAM, a 1 TB hard disk. Its an old laptop but it gets the work done.</p>

<p>I have an Asus M1 Pro which I just bought mainly for its 5000 mAh Li-Po battery.</p>

<h2 id="software">Software</h2>

<p>I use both linux and Windows OS. I use Manjaro Linux (<a href="https://manjaro.org/get-manjaro/#bspwm" target="_blank">bspwm</a>). I have tried many distros but I like Manjaro Linux the most.</p>

<p>My preferred shell to use is zsh. I use Neovim as my primary text editor in Linux and notepad in Windows. I sometime use VS code just to change things up.</p>

<p>My phone has <a href="https://lineageos.org/" target="_blank">LineageOS</a> running. I had to unlock the bootloader and to get the OS working.</p>
