            <description>Hardware I am using a Lenovo laptop (Ideapad 110-15AST). It has a 15.6 inch screen and comes with AMD A9 9400, 8 GB of RAM, a 1 TB hard disk. Its a old laptop but it gets the work done.
I have a Asus M1 Pro which I just bought mainly for its 5000 mAh Li-Po battery.
Software I use both linux and Windows OS. I use Manjaro Linux (bspwm) and Windows 10.</description>

<h2 id="software">Software</h2>
<p>I use both linux and Windows OS. I use Manjaro Linux (<a href="https://manjaro.org/get-manjaro/#bspwm">bspwm</a>) and Windows 10. I tried many distros and much distro hopping I finally settled on Manjaro Linux. I keep switching distos as there is so many choices with many distro getting nice updates.</p>
<p>My favorite shell to use is zsh. I use Gvim as my primary text editor in Linux and notepad in Windows. I sometime use VS code just to change things up.</p>
<p>My phone has <a href="https://lineageos.org/">LineageOS</a> running. I had to unlock the bootloader and to get the OS working.</p>
