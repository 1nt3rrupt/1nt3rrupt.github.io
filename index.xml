      <description>Hardware I am using a Lenovo laptop (Ideapad 110-15AST). It comes with AMD A9 9400, 8 GB of RAM, a 1 TB hard disk. Its an old laptop but it gets the work done.
I have an Asus M1 Pro which I just bought mainly for its 5000 mAh Li-Po battery.
Software I use both linux and Windows OS. I use Manjaro Linux (bspwm). I have tried many distros but I like Manjaro Linux the most.</description>
