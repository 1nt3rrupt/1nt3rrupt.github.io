      <description>Hardware I am using a Lenovo laptop (Ideapad 110-15AST). It has a 15.6 inch screen and comes with AMD A9 9400, 8 GB of RAM, a 1 TB hard disk. Its a old laptop but it gets the work done.
I have a Asus M1 Pro which I just bought mainly for its 5000 mAh Li-Po battery.
Software I use both linux and Windows OS. I use Manjaro Linux (bspwm) and Windows 10.</description>
